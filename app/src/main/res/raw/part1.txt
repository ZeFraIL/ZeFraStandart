Android Studio is the official integrated development environment (IDE) for Google's Android operating system, built on JetBrains' IntelliJ IDEA software and designed specifically for Android development.
It is available for download on Windows, macOS and Linux based operating systems.
It is a replacement for the Eclipse Android Development Tools (E-ADT) as the primary IDE for native Android application development.
Android Studio is licensed under the Apache license but it ships with some SDK updates that are under a non-free license, making it not open source.
